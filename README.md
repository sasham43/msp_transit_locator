# Minneapolis/St. Paul Transit Locator

## About
This is a side project I developed in my free time while attending Prime Digital Academy.  We had recently begun working with APIs and I wanted to practice those skills while building something that might be potentially useful.  It was also a chance to gain some exposure to the Google Maps API and to continue playing around with Bootstrap.  The application queries the MSP NexTrip API to find real-time location of city buses and light rail trains.  The user can choose to see all buses currently in service, or choose by route.  They can also click an icon to see when that bus or train reported its location.  The bus (or train) icons are color-coded by direction (either North-South or East-West).  The user can also provide their location using their mobile device or browser-based GPS data.

## Demo
There is a demo running at http://msp-transit-locator.herokuapp.com/  Note: you must access this url through http, not https.  This is due to a limitation with the NexTrip API.
